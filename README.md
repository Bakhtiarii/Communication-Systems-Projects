# Description:
- Analog Modulation

In this exercise, we will simulate analog amplitude, phase, and frequency modulations. We also examine different demodulation methods and the error caused by the difference in operating frequency in the transmitter and receiver.
- Phase and Frequency Modulations

In this exercise, we are going to implement frequency and phase modulation in basic mode. In the meantime, we will learn more about Bessel functions and their applications and we will examine their use in single-frequency modulation. In addition, we will learn about the effect of errors and structural limitations of oscillators and their impact on message recovery.
